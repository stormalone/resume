Michael Angerman’s passion is programming and finance.  Through out his career he has combined these endeavors to become successful in the software industry.

Success can be defined in many ways, but most importantly he defines it as being totally fulfilled in his professional life by helping other people work together as a team.

Business acumen comes via deeply understanding how other skilled people and companies accomplish the task of building superior software products that people want to use.  The team building effort is a function of matching each person’s strengths with the job they have to perform.

Michael’s vision of finance is all about long term buy and hold.  He views the companies he works for in that same light.  It takes years to build a successful company, and fortunately you are never done with the task at hand.  Incredible patience and focus are the ingredients that enable one to continue to hone the message and product that the company is marketing to their customer.

Michael practices these skills each and every day in his life and it translates across to his personal life as well.  He loves teaching English to native Spanish speakers, and has done so in the past while living in South America for extended periods of time both in Ecuador and Argentina.

In 2003, Michael founded Arcadian Group with the primary focus of giving something back to society. Since that time he has worked on several major projects which he would call contributions. One of them being a Science and Math Charter High School for students in grades 9 through 12 which was opened in Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2005 with $400,000 of support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through their High Tech High Initiative. Michael co-founded the school with Mayor Martin Chavez and Robin Troup an educator.
